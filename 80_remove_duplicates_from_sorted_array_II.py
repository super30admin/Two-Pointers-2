                    - We start from the slow and fast pointer from the
                      the number of duplicates allowed
                    - The slow pointer points to the position where a new
                      unique element can be inserted
                    - If the current element at the fast pointer is different
                      from two positions before the slow, this means that there
                      are already two duplicates which are same, the new element
                      to be inserted is different, so we insert the fast pointer
                      element to the slow pointer and increment slow pointer.
                    - Always increment fast pointer
