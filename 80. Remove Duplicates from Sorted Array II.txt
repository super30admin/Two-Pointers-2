// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
//we keep 2 pointers one for iterating and one for making sure to keep only two occurences
//of a number..we increase that pointer only if count is less than=2.. and when we encountrer //appropriate candidate we enter the element at that pointer. can be called insertion ponter
