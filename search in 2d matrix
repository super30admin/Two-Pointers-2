Intuition: start from last row last column, top right or bottom left
Two pointer solutions : based on single decision - which side to move - one side the numbers are increasing and on the other side the numbers are decreasing
TC = O(m+n)
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        //null
        if(matrix == null || matrix.length == 0) return false;
        int m = matrix.length; int n = matrix[0].length;
        int i = 0; int j = n-1; //first row and last column
        while( i < m && j >=0){  //i being increased and j is being decreased
            if(matrix[i][j] == target) return true;
            else if(matrix[i][j] < target){
                i++;
            } else{
